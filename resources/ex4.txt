Numbers in javascript are floating-point and sometimes you can have representation that does not match the common sense.
Fortunately there is a package called "decimal.js" that fixes this problem

Using decimal.js do the following math and print via console.log the results:
- 0.01 + 0.05
- 0.007 * 100
